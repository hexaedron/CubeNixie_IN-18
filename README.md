# IN-18 Nixie Clock project

Please note this project is not for regular Arduino, it is for LGT8F328P and in relies on Timer3.

You will also need w5500 Aliexpress module and 2 power sources: the first one is 5-12V, apply it to J_VCC connector, and the second is 180V, apply it to J_HW connector.

Remember to connect IN-18 lamps through 36K-43K 2W resistor and IN-3 through 100K 0.25W resistor.
